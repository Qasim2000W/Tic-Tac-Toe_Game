A desktop application implementing the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game with full two-player functionality. Manages
game state internally (cell status, player turns, move counter) and prevents overwriting occupied cells. Checks
for win conditions horizontally, vertically, and diagonally after each move, and automatically detects draws.
Announces the result and ends the round, with a reset feature to start a new game.
Technologies Used: C#, .NET Framework.
